# JavaScript30 Challenge 22 - Follow Links
Highlight links when hovered upon dynamically

## Lessons learned

This exercise was also pretty short but it did include some nifty tricks that, as Wes said, will come in handy in a future, bigger exercise.

I didn't make any changes but, if any idea comes to me, I might make things a bit more personal, like gradient for the color of the highlight.
