# JavaScript30 Challenge 13 - Slide in on scroll
Slide in images in a website when the user scrolls to their location

## Lessons learned

This exercise was pretty nifty as it involved a lot of math about the window and viewport size, as well as the size of other elements on a page, such as images.

The slide in effect for the images is pretty cool and, when combined with lazy loading, might come in handy in future projects, to reduce the initial size of a page.
