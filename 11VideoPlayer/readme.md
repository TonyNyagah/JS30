# JavaScript30 Challenge 11 - HTML5 Video Player
Customize the HTML5 Video Player with more advanced features

## Lessons learned

This wasn't the best exercise so far, largely because I can't get the video to play while acessing the website locally. I think it's to do with the linked file eused by Wes, although I've tried it with video files from my hard drive. I've even pasted code from other people who took Wes' course and still nothing happened.

The code is the one from Wes, with some modifications from me to add the extra fullscreen capability. At some point in time, I will experiment with the file online to see if that was the problem.
