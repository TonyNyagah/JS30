# JavaScript30 Challenge 28 - Video speed controller
Control the speed of a video using a dedicated bar

## Lessons learned

I am a fan of watching videos at a higher speed than the normal 1x. I usually go for 1.5x and, if things get really hectic, I slow it down for some scenes.

As such, this functionality demonstrated by Wes in this exercise was right up my alley. Again, the actual code doesn't seem like much but I am a fan of Wes explaining the pretty tricky math that goes into ensuring everything works as intended.
