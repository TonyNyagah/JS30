# JavaScript30 Challenge 26 - Dropdown Follow
Get a dropdown to follow cursor through a nav bar

## Lessons learned

Wes piqued my interest with the nav bar used by Stripe in a previous exercise and the actual lesson that focused on recreating it didn't disappoint.

It's great to see broken down the functionality from another website, especially one that looks so interesting in action. Again, Wes emphasizes the importance of doing some math to ensure that the dropdown appears where it should be, no matter the additions or substractions from the page.

I modified the personal details to my own and I may perform a few more tweaks in the future.
