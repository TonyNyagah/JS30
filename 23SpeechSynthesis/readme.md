# JavaScript30 Challenge 23 - Speech Synthesis
Synthesize speech and utter text written by the user

## Lessons learned

Once again, Wes shows a relatively simple but extremely powerful application of JavaScript with this exercise. Using speech synthesis and allowing users to alter options like pitch and rate is certainly an eye-catching (ear-pleasing?) experience.

I don't think I'll experiment with this exercise anytime soon but I will probably study its `style.css` file more in-depth to get a handle on the great design of the page.
