# JavaScript30 Challenge 16 - Shadow on Mouse Move
Change the orientation of a shadow depending on the movement of the mouse

## Lessons learned

This one was quite fun and, after the pretty complex Local Storage experiment, a welcomed change of pace.

It's always great to see how some crazy effects, like the shadows in the exercise, actually work, and the various bits of JavaScript "magic" a developer needs to do in order to ensure everything goes smoothly.
